	Runtimes tab: Configure runtimes (E.g. python35 home), change precedence of runtimes for overlapping file extensions
	Environment tab: Assemblies and Workspaces (Directories)

Main Window:
	Toolbar: Remove 'Convert To Python' button
	Document: ActiveDocument not selected on startup
	Document: CTRL+Scroll text zooming

Console MVVM:
	PythonNET: Inputted text reaplced after entered
	TextLines binding can cause lagging when constaly printing to console, investigate solution

Explorer MVVM:
	Break up Explorer view/viewmodel/model to make it more manageable
	-> Or maybe just rewrite that ugly mess

Execution Engines:
	FileExt: Change to array, allow for multiple file extensions per language/runtime
	PythonNET: Ensure COM interop is working properly and test a variety of cases.

AddIn:
	MacroUI: Wait for MacroUI to initialize before executing destroy command

MacroUI:
	OnComplete: Minimize unnecessary use of OnComplete actions

Macros:
	Cannot run a macro directly after creating it, cannot resolve path

Extensibility (UI):
	Allow for UI to be extensible with different Document and Tool views/models/viewmodels (Eg. Console, Explorer, Source Control, etc.)
	Make accents extensible? Instead registering in VSTO it can be loaded via MEF and set in VSTO or Settings Flyout???
