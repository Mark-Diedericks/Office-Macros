Settings Flyout:
	Runtimes tab: Configure runtimes (E.g. python35 home), change precedence of runtimes for overlapping file extensions
	Environment tab: Assemblies and Workspaces (Directories)
	Macros tab:	Macros organized by Workspaces (Directories), Macros organized by filetype?

Main Window:
	.

Console MVVM:
	TextLines binding can cause lagging when constantly printing to console, investigate solution

Explorer MVVM:
	Break up Explorer view/viewmodel/model to make it more manageable
		-> Or maybe just rewrite that ugly mess
		-> CreateTreeViewItemStructure FileAttributes
	Drag and drop file into editor to open

Execution Engines:
	FileExt: Change to array, allow for multiple file extensions per language/runtime
	PythonNET: Ensure COM interop is working properly

AddIn:
	.

MacroUI:
	Single instance of MacroUI for all open office app instances? 
	-> Perhaps drop down to select which office app to execute on? (Automatically changing accent color to reflect this)

Macros:
	User Defined Functions (UDFs)
	Embed scripts in Excel (as hidden worksheets? or as VBA modules but with other code?)

Extensibility (UI):
	Allow for UI to be extensible with different Document and Tool views/models/viewmodels (Eg. Console, Explorer, Source Control, etc.)
	Make accents extensible? Instead registering in VSTO it can be loaded via MEF and set in VSTO or Settings Flyout???
